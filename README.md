# Data Analytics Maturity Model for Financial Sector
This repository contains the artifacts corresponding to a proposed Maturity Model for financial organizations which want to improve their analytics level. This Maturity Model was developed by Jonathan Perales and Jorge Molina - UPC Lima, Peru.

## Description of the Maturity Model

As inputs for the model, information is used about the current situation of the data analytics processes, made up of surveys made to the key participants of said processes and workproducts.
This information goes through 3 stages: In the Dimensioning stage, the information collected is classified according to the dimension by which it will be analyzed, so that the data analytics processes can be analyzed from five different points of view: Analytical Government , Information Technologies, Culture, Data Analytics and Data Management. Later, in the Diagnostic stage, the evaluator chooses the level at which one or more data analytics processes are based on a given dimension. Finally, based on all the information raised in the diagnosis, the evaluator elaborates proposals for improvement from different points of view.

## Artifacts

1. **Reference Matrix:** This matrix contains the dimensions separated per level. At intersections, there is a group of conditions that must be met to select a level of maturity according to each dimension. The detail of each dimensi√≥n with their respective level description is shown on the Populate phase.

2. **Workproducts:** Group of deliverables that the user evaluator of the maturity model will use as part of the inputs to perform the evaluation of the analytical processes. These deliverables are the necessary evidence that will justify the feedback given through the survey by the members of the organization's data analytics team. Deliverables may vary according to the characteristics of the organization.

3. **Staff Evaluation Survey:** Consists of a series of questions addressed to the workers of the organization that aims to capture the perception they have regarding data analytics and how it is directly involved with them. The purpose of this survey is to help the evaluator to be able to have the necessary information regarding the personnel and thus be able to make the diagnosis more easily. This survey consists of a series of questions that can be answered with the personal opinion of each employee, as well as quantifiable questions regarding various aspects of analytics in the organization.

4. **Diagnostic Tool:** Likewise, the model includes a diagnostic tool in which the evaluator can use in order to have a better vision of the current panorama of the organization with respect to data analytics. This tool consists of a series of questions to answer yes or no to each dimension and based on the answers provided by the evaluator, the level of maturity will be known. In the case of validation, this tool was represented in an Excel file, however, it can also be captured within an application.

5. **Best Practices Manual:** These practices were defined by *Clarke (2018)* consist of guides or actions that can be taken as a reference to implement improvements in the analytical processes and that have already been put into practice with good results by different companies.

6. **Final Report Template:** seeks to facilitate the representation of the current situation of the organization based on the diagnosis made. In this template summarizes the maturity levels found by each dimension, the justification of these levels, the recommendations to improve the current situation based on the good practices included in the model and the gap found that is suggested to solve as a priority.
